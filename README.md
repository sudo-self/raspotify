Raspotify is a [Debian package and associated repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)) for [Debian Stable](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/) ( ***Currently Debian 11 "Bullseye"*** ) and other Debian Stable based/compatible OS's ( ***your mileage may vary*** ) which thinly wraps [a fork](https://github.com/JasonLG1979/librespot/tree/raspotify) of the awesome [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) library by [Paul Lietar](https://github.com/plietar) and others up as a [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) [daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)).

Raspotify is intended to be used in a *[headless enviroment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_computer)*. For desktop OS's [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd) offers similar functionality and is a better choice. If you're looking for a turnkey audio solution for Raspberry Pi's with Spotify Connect support we recommend [moOdeâ„¢ audio player](https://moodeaudio.org/).

**Librespot, and therefore Raspotify, requires a premium account.**
